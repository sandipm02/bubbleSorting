#Bubble Pushing Array Algo
Parses through data and rearranges it emplyoing a double loop, replacing 
values depending on if it is larger or smaller. Smaller values are
placed on the left position, and larger ones are placed in the right position.
This is repeated until the full array is sorted, then it is displayed.
